Hey there!
I'm an independent developper.

I'm currrently working on multiple projects,
from simple customized discord bots to commercial indie game.
I am also working on my own custom javascript library/console at https://github.com/ThePywon/PywonConsole.

I'm currently learning some new skills everyday on multiple languages.
I like to do stuff alone and learn it on my own.

I'm not really looking to collaborate on any projects yet,
altho I am welcoming with open arms anyone who wishes to help in any way.

I am pretty decent in using platforms such as Unity, Atom, Github, Replit.
I also know how to code in html, css, javascript, python, csharp.

Twitter (I dont use often)

If you'd like to start any project with me, just reach out to me and I'll be glad to.
